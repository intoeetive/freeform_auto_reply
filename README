Freeform auto reply is the extension for ExpressionEngine 2 that works together with Solspace Freeform.

It allows to automatically send email to user when his Freeform submission is edited in Control Panel (e.g. status is changed)

To get it working, you need to create a checkbox Freeform field and select it as "trigger" in extension settings. You also need to provide email subject and message templates for each Freeform status. 

Whenever Freeform submission is edited in CP, the trigger field is checked and the templates for status of entry/submission is not empty, a message is sent to the submission author.

In templates, all freeform fields are availabe as variables, e.g. {first_name}, {last_name}, {email} etc.
